# Linked List
> A linked list is a collection of data elements alled nodes in which the linear representation is given by links from one node to the next node.

A linked list does not store its elements in consecutive memory locations and the user can add any number of elements to it. However, unlike an array, a linked list does not allow random access of data. Elements in a linked list can be accessed only in a sequential manner. But like an array, insertions and deletions can be done at any point in the list in a constant time.

## Basic Terminologies

1. **Node** : A Linked List is a linear collection of data elements. These data elements are called nodes.

2. Each node consists of two parts, an integer and a pointer to the next node.

Since in a linked list, every node contains a pointer to another node which is of the same type, it is also called a *self-referential data type*s.
