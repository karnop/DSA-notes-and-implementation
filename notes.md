# Data Structures in C++

> A **Data Structure** is a way to store and organize data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

## Abstract data types
> These data types define data and operations but no implementation. Ex : Arrays, Linked List, Stacks, Queues etc..

## DS to Learn
>**Beginner**: Linked List, Stack, Queue, Binary Search Tree.

>**Intermediate**: Heap, Priority Queue, Huffman Tree, Union Find, Tries, Hash Table, Tree Map.

>**Proficient**: Segment Tree, Binary Indexed Tree, Suffix Array, Sparse Table, Lowest Common Ancestor, Range Tree.

>**Expert**: Suffix Automaton, Suffix Tree, Heavy-Light Decomposition, Treap, Aho-Corasick, K-d tree, Link-Cut Tree, Splay Tree, Palindromic Tree, Rope, Dancing Links, Radix Tree, Dynamic Suffix Array.
