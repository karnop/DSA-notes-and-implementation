# Data Structures in C++

> A **Data Structure** is a way to store and organize data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

## Abstract data types
> These data types define data and operations but no implementation. Ex : Arrays, Linked List, Stacks, Queues etc..

## DS to Learn
>**Beginner**: Linked List, Stack, Queue, Binary Search Tree.

>**Intermediate**: Heap, Priority Queue, Huffman Tree, Union Find, Tries, Hash Table, Tree Map.

>**Proficient**: Segment Tree, Binary Indexed Tree, Suffix Array, Sparse Table, Lowest Common Ancestor, Range Tree.

>**Expert**: Suffix Automaton, Suffix Tree, Heavy-Light Decomposition, Treap, Aho-Corasick, K-d tree, Link-Cut Tree, Splay Tree, Palindromic Tree, Rope, Dancing Links, Radix Tree, Dynamic Suffix Array.

### Arrays 
1. Program for array rotation
2. Reversal algorithm for array rotation
3. Block swap algorithm for array rotation
4. Program to cyclically rotate an array by one
5. Search an element in a sorted and rotated array
6. Given a sorted and rotated array, find if there is a pair with a given sum
7. Find maximum value of Sum( i*arr[i]) with only rotations on given array allowed
8. Maximum sum of i*arr[i] among all rotations of a given array
9. Find the Rotation Count in Rotated Sorted array
10. Quickly find multiple left rotations of an array
11. Find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array
12. Reversal algorithm for right rotation of an array
13. Find a rotation with maximum hamming distance
14. Queries on Left and Right Circular shift on array
15. Print left rotation of array in O(n) time and O(1) space
16. Find element at given index after a number of rotations
17. Split the array and add the first part to the end
